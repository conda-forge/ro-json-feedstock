  summary: "Extra features for Python's JSON: comments, order, numpy, pandas, datetimes, and many more! Simple but customizable."

  description: |
    The pyjson-tricks package brings several pieces of functionality to python handling of json files:
    (1) store and load numpy arrays in human-readable format;
    (2) store and load class instances both generic and customized;
    (3) store and load date/times as a dictionary (including timezone);
    (4) preserve map order {} using OrderedDict;
    (5) allow for comments in json files by starting lines with #;
    (6) sets, complex numbers, decimal, fraction, enums, compression, duplicate keys, etc.
    As well as compression and disallowing duplicate keys.
